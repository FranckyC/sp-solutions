# Sharepoint Framework renderer for react-search-refiners

## Summary
This sample is an example on how to use custom code renderers in the react-search-refiners project. Custom code renderers lets you render the search results from a react-search-refiners webpart in your own way, with whatever tools you prefer.
Typically, you will use SPFx Application Customizers to mount these renderers, but you may also use SPFx Webparts. This sample contains a SPFx Application Customizer which uses React and Office-UI-Fabric-React to render the search results.

## Minimal Path to Awesome

- Follow the Minimal Path to Awesome for [React Search Refiners](https://github.com/SharePoint/sp-dev-fx-webparts/tree/master/samples/react-search-refiners).
- In this repository, run from the command line: 
    - `npm install`
    - `gulp serve`


## Creating your own renderers 
The renderer bundlet in this sample is a simple renderer designed to show how a simple implementation of a code renderer would look like. Following is a quick tour of the setup-process and the different settings you will encounter when creating your own renderer. 

### Registering a new renderer
The renderers work by announcing themselves to any react-search-refiners webparts that exists on the pages they are installed on. The registration process is handled by the 'registerRenderer'- function in the 'ResultService' - class in './src/services'. A typicall registration will take place onInit.

The parameters of the registerRenderer function:

 - **rendererId**: The id of the current renderer. Used to idententify which renderer the user has selected. Typically 'this.componentId'.
 - **rendererName**: The displayName of the renderer in the react-search-refiners webpart property panel. 
 - **rendererIcon**: The office-ui-fabric-react icon that should be displayed in the property pane of the webpart.
 - **callback**:  The callback function that is used to render the webpart. This will be called when the renderer is selected and new data is available. 
 - **customFields**: Optional names of custom fields that may be used for templating in the renderer.

### Templating
By registering a field-name in the 'customFields' value, you may expose them to the user, letting them choose which fields should be displayed in different places in your renderer. In the bundled example, a subheader is passed along as a template field. The dropdown selection that the user can chose elements from are the elements selected for fetching by the search webpart.
